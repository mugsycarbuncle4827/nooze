<p><strong>California's Proposed Wealth Tax Targets Tech Founders' Voting Shares, Not Just 5% Rate</strong></p>
<p>Silicon Valley billionaires are considering leaving California not just because of the proposed 5% wealth tax rate, but because it would specifically target founders' voting shares rather than their actual equity holdings. This structure would disproportionately impact tech leaders like Larry Page, who owns about 3% of his company's total equity but holds significant voting control through special share classes.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Damon Says Netflix Requires Movies to Repeat Plot Points for Distracted Viewers</strong></p>
