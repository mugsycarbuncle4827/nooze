<p>A new Wall Street Journal investigation reveals ongoing conflicts between Disney Imagineers and executives, with creative teams consistently blocked from developing original attractions in favor of IP-based projects. The report details how a major Marvel e-ticket ride was cancelled due to executive distrust of Imagineering, while Disney Legend Joe Rohde has responded to claims about "progressive seduction" tactics used by creative teams.
