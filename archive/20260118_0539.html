<h2>News</h2>
<p><strong>Trump Threatens 10% Tariffs on European Allies Over Greenland Opposition</strong></p>
<p>President Trump announced 10% tariffs on several European countries starting in February after they opposed his plans to purchase Greenland. European leaders have called the tariff threats "unacceptable" and "deeply unhelpful," with protests occurring in Greenland's capital Nuuk. The escalating trade dispute has thrown the world economy into chaos and raised concerns about the future of NATO.</p>

<p><strong>California and Los Angeles Consider New Taxes on Ultra-Wealthy Residents</strong></p>
<p>New initiatives in California and Los Angeles aim to tax the state's richest residents amid a growing affordability crisis. The proposals come as California faces the nation's most expensive housing market and highest income taxes. The focus on wealthy taxpayers reflects mounting pressure to address rising costs for average residents.</p>

<p><strong>US Bond Market Remains Strong Despite Growing National Debt</strong></p>
<p>America's bond market continues to outperform expectations even as national debt balloons and the Federal Reserve faces political attacks. Bond market vigilantes have largely shrugged off concerns about fiscal sustainability. The resilience comes despite mounting economic uncertainties and political pressures on monetary policy.</p>

<p><strong>Trump Administration Pauses Visa Processing for 75 Countries Over Welfare Usage</strong></p>
<p>The State Department announced it will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants allegedly use welfare "at unacceptable rates." Affected countries include Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. The move represents a significant expansion of immigration restrictions beyond Trump's previous focus on illegal immigration to include legal pathways.</p>

<p><strong>Iran Faces Potential "Extreme Digital Isolation" as Internet Shutdown Expands</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fan-Fiction Hockey Romance "Heated Rivalry" Adapted for Television</strong></p>
<p>A TV drama based on Rachel Reid's "Heated Rivalry" books about an illicit relationship between two star hockey players has gained widespread attention. The author originally thought her fan-fiction works about gay hockey players were "unadaptable" for mainstream television. The adaptation represents a breakthrough for LGBTQ+ sports romance content in mainstream media.</p>

However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's testimony on Capitol Hill appears to have significantly disrupted the industry's political momentum and legislative timeline. The setback threatens what was anticipated to be a breakthrough moment for establishing clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets.</p>
